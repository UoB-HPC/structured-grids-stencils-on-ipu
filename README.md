This is the code that is discussed in our paper that we presented at the 3rd Workshop on Accelerated Machine Learning (AccML) at HiPEAC 2021 on 18th January 2021.

To build the code, you will need the Graphcore SDK installed with paths set up as in the SDK instructions.

You should also make these paths available to CMAKE (using the CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH paths).
